## Sorting Algorithms Visualized

Currently implemented sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- LSD RadixSort

Planned sorting algorithms:
- MSD RadixSort
- HeapSort

The program doesn't show the algorithms in real time, it does calculate the sorting beforehand, save all the steps while sorting and does then replay them in a given frame rate

If you want to change settings, like the frame rate, go to "Project/src/_main/setting/_Settings.java"

If you want to see the cool looking sorting without running it yourself, there are .mp4 video files in "Recordings" folder

You can suggest which sorting algorithms I should do next
