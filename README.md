## Quicksort Algorithm Visualized
I learned how the quicksort algorithm works and wanted to code it with a visual representation on the sorting

I don't know if the way I coded it, is the best and most optimized way to make it, but it works

The program doesn't show it in real time, it does calculate the sorting beforehand, save all the steps while sorting and does then replay them in a given frame rate

If you want to change settings, go to "Project/src/_main/setting/_Settings.java"

If you want to see the cool looking sorting without running it yourself, there are .mp4 video files in "Recordings" folder

Maybe I will do more sorting algorithms in the future
