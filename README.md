# Sorting Algorithms Visualized

## Currently implemented sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- ShellSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- LSD RadixSort

## Planned sorting algorithms:
- MSD RadixSort
- HeapSort

## General Information

The program doesn't show the algorithms in real time, it does calculate the sorting beforehand, save all the steps while sorting and does then replay them in a given frame rate

This means that it doesn't really show how long a sorting algorithm takes, just how many changes he does to the array

If you want to change settings, like the frame rate, go to "Project/src/_main/setting/_Settings.java"

If you want to see the cool looking sorting without running it yourself, there are .mp4 video files in "Recordings" folder

(the recordings, in the folder, all have different frame rates, so it does not show which one is the fastest or takes the least amount of steps)

You can suggest which sorting algorithms I should do next
